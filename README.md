ncoverjs
========

.NET JavaScript Code Coverage tool

This is a .NET 4 port of the <a href="https://github.com/yui/yuitest">yuitest-coverage</a> 
and <a href="https://github.com/yui/yuitest">yuitest-coverage-reporter</a> Javas apps.

It includes a pre-compiled Lexer and Parser for the ES3 version of JavaScript.

My goal it to be compatible with the original yuitest coverage tool, but with minor 
improvements.
